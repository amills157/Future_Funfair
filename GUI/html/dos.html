  <button class="collapsible">What is a DOS attack?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A Denial of Service (DOS) attack is used to overwhelm a system so users cannot access information or network resources such as a website. This is done by flooding a host with traffic until they cannot respond or the host crashes.</p>

  <button class="collapsible">Identifying DOS attacks</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A DOS attack can cause the LEGO motors to stop or slow down.</p>
    <p>You can also identify this attack through Wireshark. It will show multiple packets being sent to one IP address.</p>
    <p>The payloads of these packets are likely to be junk.</p>
