      What is a Cyber Physical System (CPS)?
      <br>
      <br>
      A CPS is basically a computer that controls sensors or motors. When computer controllers and physical systems are closely linked and rely on each other it's a CPS 
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples of CPS include smart grid, autonomous cars, medical devices, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and robotics systems. You can find CPS in every day life. Including fairgrounds 
      <br>
      <br>
      However when we have computers and physical systems so closely linked it means that if something goes wrong with one it impacts the other...
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope our fairground rides are OK... We should probably go check on them!
