# Future Funfair - 

This repository holds the code for the ` Teaching CyBOK through Cyber Physical Systems` project run by the [University of the West of England (UWE)](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/), externally funded by the [Cyber Security Book of Knowledge (CyBoK)](https://www.cybok.org/). 

This project was run at the UWE [Unlock Cyber](https://www.unlockcyber.com/) event.

The project itself has two main code bases

### GUI

The UI - This is utilised by students / participants and provides information about Cyber Physical Systems, CyBoK and the different attacks and countermeasures. 

It is also where the students / participants will mitigate and resolve ongoing attacks

### CPS_Code

This contains the backend code which runs the attacks and the Pi server itself
